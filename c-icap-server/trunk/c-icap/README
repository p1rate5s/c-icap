This is NOT a real release. Must considered just as a stable snapshot 
from cvs repository. Read the INSTALL.txt file and web pages at 
http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/ for information about how to configure.

COMMENTS:
*c-icap is more tested in Linux systems. However compiles and runs at least 
in solaris 10 and FreeBSD 5.x and possibly in other platforms.

*The format of file c-icap.magic has changed. If you use your own c-icap.magic
file remember to convert it to new format. You can also use the 
convert_old_magic.pl utility in contrib directory to convert it.

*ipv6 support for Linux and Solaris looks that works OK but it is not 
enough tested.

*Although I was able to compile c-icap with IPv6 support in FreeBSD 5.x
it was not possible for me to make it to work. Maybe becouse of bugs in 
implementation maybe becouse of my inability to correctly setup the ipv6
in FreeBSD.
