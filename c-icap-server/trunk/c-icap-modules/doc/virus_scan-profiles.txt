WARNING! Using profiles in virus_scan service may open serious
security hole in your http cache systems. Wrong configuration
can allow viruses stored in your web cache.
Do not enable/use profiles in virus_scan service unless you are
sure what you are doing. Please refer to "Problems/Bugs" paragraph.


Enable profiles for virus_scan service
======================================

Use the --enable-virus_scan-profiles option in configure script to enable
and use configuration profiles in virus_scan service:
 ./configure --with-c-icap=/usr/local/c-icap/ --prefix=/usr/local/c-icap/ --enable-virus_scan-profiles


c-icap.conf configuration
=========================

The configuration parameters to configure and use profiles for virus_scan 
service are the followings:

TAG: virus_scan.Profile
Format: virus_scan.Profile profile_name param val1 [val2 ...]
Description:
	Supported param values are:
		DisableVirusScan Disable viruses scanning for icap requests
			matching the given profile.
		SendPercentData Overwrite the default virus_scan.SendPercentData
			value for icap requests matching the given profile
		ScanFileTypes Overwrite the default virus_scan.ScanFileTypes
			list for icap requests matching the given profile
		VirScanFileTypes For which file types the virelator mode should
			used for icap requests matching the given profile
		MaxObjectSize Overwrite the virus_scan.MaxObjectSize value for
			requests matching given profile. If this value is
			greater than the virus_scan.MaxObjectSize value then
			the virus_scan.MaxObjectSize value used.
		StartSendingDataAfter Overwrite the virus_scan.StartSendingDataAfter
			value for requests matching given profile.
		DefaultEngine Space separated list of the antivirus engines to
			use if no engine has selected using ICAP service
			arguments

TAG: virus_scan.ProfileAccess
Format: virus_scan.ProfileAccess profile_name acl1 [acl2 ...]
Description:
	Used to select profile based on acls

Example configuration
=====================

Scenario: 
 1) We do not want to scan objects comming from microsoft 
 2) We do not want to use virelator mode for objects smaller than 5Mb

Here is a sample configuration file

#Default values configuration:
virus_scan.ScanFileTypes HTML TEXT EXECUTABLE GIF JPEG MSOFFICE PDF SWF ARCHIVE
virus_scan.SendPercentData 5
virus_scan.StartSendPercentDataAfter 2M
virus_scan.MaxObjectSize  5M
virus_scan.VirScanFileTypes EXECUTABLE ARCHIVE

# Defining NoScan profile
virus_scan.Profile NoScan DisableVirusScan
# Defining NoVir profile
# Use the default SendPercentData, StartSendPercentDataAfter and MaxObjectSize
# Do not define the VirScanFileTypes variable for the given profile
virus_scan.Profile NoVir ScanFileTypes HTML TEXT EXECUTABLE GIF JPEG MSOFFICE PDF SWF ARCHIVE

# Select the correct profile using acls
acl MICROSOFT http_req_header{Host} /\.microsoft.com/
acl BigObjects http_resp_header{Content-Length} /^([5-9]|[0-9][0-9]+)[0-9]{6}$/
virus_scan.ProfileAccess NoScan MICROSOFT
virus_scan.ProfileAccess NoVir !BigObjects

Problems/Bugs
=============

Assume the following scenario
 - squid is configured to use c-icap virus_scan service
 - the system administrator has setup two profiles, NoScan and FullScan
 - Some of the users belongs to group NoScanGroup configured to use NoScan
   profile, and some other users belongs to FullScanGroup configured to use
   the FullScan profile
 - A user from group NoScanGroup download an infected object. The object stored
   in squid cache.
 - A user from group FullScanGroup access the same object. The object served
   from cache and does not send to the icap server for scanning.

The above scenario whould work without any problem if the web-cache/proxy sends
the data for scanning after the data cached or in other words implements the
"after cache ICAP vectoring point". Unfortunately squid3 implements only the
pre-cache ICAP vectoring point, which means that it sends object to the
ICAP server before cached.

The system administrator who want to use profiles MUST use only server-side
acls (eg destination domain) to select the profile and never use profiles
based on client.
