#	  acl VSCAN service virus_scan
#	  AccessLog /var/log/c-icap-access-vscan.log myVScanFmt VSCAN
#	
#	The following additional formatting codes can be used with the service

# Example:
#	Service antivirus_module virus_scan.so
#	ServiceAlias  avscan virus_scan?allow204=on&sizelimit=off&mode=simple
#

# Load the virus_scan service:
Service antivirus_module virus_scan.so

#Add an alias to srv_clamav for compatibility with old service name
ServiceAlias srv_clamav virus_scan

# Add the alias avscan for virus_scan service. It is used by many
# ICAP based antivirus clients:
