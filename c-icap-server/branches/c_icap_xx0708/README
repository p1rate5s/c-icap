This is NOT a real release. Must considered just as a stable snapshot 
from cvs repository. Read the INSTALL.txt file and web pages at 
http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/ for information about how to configure.

COMMENTS:
*c-icap is more tested in Linux systems. However compiles and runs at least 
in FreeBSD 6.x and possibly in other platforms. At regular times I am 
testing it also in solaris 10. I was not able to check this release due 
to a problem in my solaris machine. I will do it soon...

*ipv6 support for Linux and Solaris looks that works OK but it is not 
enough tested.

*Although I was able to compile c-icap with IPv6 support in FreeBSD 5.x-6.x
it was not possible for me to make it to work. Maybe becouse of bugs in 
implementation maybe becouse of my inability to correctly setup the ipv6
in FreeBSD.
